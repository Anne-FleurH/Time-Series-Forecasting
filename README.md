# Time-Series-Forecasting

## Overview

The dataset is provided by one of the largest fast-food restaurant chains in the US. It includes (1)
transaction information such as menu items that were purchased and quantities of each item; (2)
ingredient lists for individual menu items; (3) metadata on restaurants, including location, and store
type. The data observation window is from early March, 2015 to 06/15/2015 and includes transactional
data from 2 stores in Berkeley, CA and 2 stores in New York, NY.

Your job is to forecast the daily demand for the next two weeks (from 06/16/2015 to 06/29/2015) to
help the managers make inventory replenishment decisions. In particular, you need to forecast demand
for one specific ingredient: lettuce, for each of the four individual restaurants. You are expected to use
both Holt-Winters and ARIMA methods in generating the forecast. The deliverable of the coursework
includes a written report (submit both rmd file, and pdf/html file), and the forecast results summarized
in a csv file.
